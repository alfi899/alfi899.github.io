### Amazing Song Lyrics
>This is a wierd png file. I hope you can make some sense out of it!
> Note: Wrap the flag in n00bz{} and flag is all lowercase Author: NoobMaster

For this challenge we get just a png file. If we take a look at that picture it seem to look 
like signlangugage. 

![Song Lyrics](/assets/img/n00bzCTF/song_lyrics_1.png)

A little google research on signlanguage and we are able to "read" what the image says.
In the end it says: americansignlanguagedecoded

FLAG: `n00bz{americansignlanguagedecoded}`

### Google Form 1
>Binary Flag Checkers are old, so how about some Google Forms Flag Checker?

For this challenge we are given with a website where we can input a flag and check 
if it is the right one. Unfortunally it always return that we have the incorrect flag.

![Google Form](/assets/img/n00bzCTF/google_form_1.png)

If we look at the source code we can search for the n00bz pattern and find the flag like this.

FLAG: `noobz{1n5p3ct_3l3m3n7_ftw!}`

### My Chemical Romance
>My friend loves Chemistry very much specially the elements. Once I asked him the wifi password
>he gave me some numbers like 186808155710 and told me that the number are in group of two like
>1008 -> 10 and 08/8. Can you help to gather the wifi password?

If we take a look at the description we an see that the number 186808155710 is in the group of two.
So as already mentioned, 1008 is going to be "10" as the first group and "08" as the second group.

If we do this for the whole number we get 6 groups of numbers. As the title of this challenge is a hint,
these numbers are the numbers of chemical elements.

![chemical](/assets/img/n00bzCTF/chemical_1.png)

If we assign every element to every number and take the short letters we get the flag.

FLAG: `n00bz{aeroplane}`

## Web

### Club_N00bz
>Can you get in the club?

If we take a look at the provided website we see a text that says we are not allowed to get 
in the club and a check status button. It also says that only the most "radical" hackers can get in.

![club 1](/assets/img/n00bzCTF/club_1.png)

If we press the check status button we get to a new page where a it says that we are not on 
the member's list.
Also in the url is a new parameter "secret_phrase" which is set to "nope".

![Club 2](/assets/img/n00bzCTF/club_2.png)

Remembering that on the first page it says that only the "radical" hacker get in.
So i changed the secret_phrase from "nope" to "radical" and was able to get on the guest list.

FLAG: `n00bz{see_you_in_the_club_acting_real_nice}`

### Robots
>Dang, if only there was some standardized way to tell webcrawlers how to index your site.<br>
>I guess we have to build our own :shrug:

If we look at the website we see a text displayed.

![robots](/assets/img/n00bzCTF/robots_1.png)


So the first idea is to check the robots.txt file. And the flag was right there.

![robots](/assets/img/n00bzCTF/robots_2.png)                    


FLAG: `n00bz{1_f0und_7h3_r0b0ts!}`

### Secret Group
>To get the flag, you must be a member of the secret group!

Looking at the website it says that we are not an agent of the secure n00bz-4dm1n browser.
                    
![secret Group 1](/assets/img/n00bzCTF/secret_group_1.png)

So the first idea was to change the user agent to n00bz-4dm1n. For this I used Burp Suite.

Changing the User-Agent to n00bz-4dm1n leads to a different response.

![secret Group 2](/assets/img/n00bzCTF/secret_group_2.png)

It does not Accept fl4g, so we need to chenge the Accept header to "fl4g". 

![secret Group 3](/assets/img/n00bzCTF/secret_group_3.png)


After that we get another response which says that the Connection is not "s3cur3".
So change the Connection.

![secret Group 4](/assets/img/n00bzCTF/secret_group_4.png)


We get another response. So we change the Referer.

![secret Group 5](/assets/img/n00bzCTF/secret_group_5.png)


The next thing we need to change is the "Give-Flag" header and set it to "7ru3". 
And we get the Flag. 

![secret Group 6](/assets/img/n00bzCTF/secret_group_6.png)
                

FLAG: `n00bz{y0u_4r3_n0w_4_v4l1d_m3mb3r_0f_th3_s3cr3t_gr0up!}`

### Conditions
>Come and get the flag... Only if you can pass these impossible to pass conditions!

For this challenge we have a website and the code of the appliation.
On the website we have an input filed to input a username. The name is either too long 
or too short.

![conditions 1](/assets/img/n00bzCTF/conditions_1.png)

If we take a look at the source code we see the condition function.

![Confditions 2](/assets/img/n00bzCTF/conditions_2.png)

If the username length is bigger than 40, the username is too long. If the name 
is under 50 characters it is too short.
If nothing of these two are true, then we get the flag returned.
So to skip the first condition we need less than 40 characters. But then we are under 50 and 
the second condition is true.
In the second condition is the "upper()" function, which converts our provided username in 
Uppser case written letters.


After some trying and thinking I found out, that upper("ß") == ss. So one letter is after 
the upper() operation two letters. So we can start with less than 40 characters, like 39 times ß 
and skip the first condition. After that the second condition uses the upper() function and we 
have 39*2=78 characters, which is bigger than 50 and we skip the second condition.

I put all if this in a small python script. 

![Conditions 3](/assets/img/n00bzCTF/conditions_3.png)

After executing this script, we get the Flag.

FLAG: `n00bz{1mp0551bl3_c0nd1t10n5_m0r3_l1k3_p0551bl3_c0nd1t10ns}`
